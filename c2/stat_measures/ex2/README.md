**What the code is about:**

Imagine you have a list of flowers (the "iris.csv" file). Each flower has information like its petal length written down. This code is like a curious gardener who wants to know things about the petal lengths of all these flowers.

* It finds the longest and shortest petal.
* It calculates how spread out the petal lengths are (variance and standard deviation).
* It figures out some special points in the list of petal lengths:
    * The point where 25% of the flowers have shorter petals.
    * The middle point where half the flowers have shorter petals, and half have longer.
    * The point where 75% of the flowers have shorter petals.
* Finally, it tells you all these interesting things it found out!

**How to think about writing this code:**

1. **Get the flower data**: 
   * We use `os.Open` to open the file containing the flower data.
   * We create a `dataframe` to help us read and work with the data in the file.

2. **Pick the petal lengths**:
   * We tell the code to look specifically at the column named "petal_length" in our flower data.
   * We convert these petal lengths into numbers we can do math with (`Float()`).

3. **Do the math**:
   * We use special tools (`floats`, `stat`) to:
     * Find the biggest (`Max`) and smallest (`Min`) petal length.
     * Calculate the range (biggest - smallest).
     * Calculate how spread out the petal lengths are (variance and standard deviation).
     * Find those special points (quantiles) we talked about earlier.

4. **Tell us the results**:
   * We use `fmt.Printf` to neatly display all the interesting things we calculated about the petal lengths.

**In simple words:**

This code is like a helpful assistant that reads a list of flower petal lengths and then tells you some useful summaries about them!
