This code (e2.go) is like a special calculator that helps us decide if something is happening by chance or if there's a real pattern. Imagine you have a bag of colorful candies, and you want to know if the colors are mixed evenly or if there are more of one color than expected.

The code does this by:
1. Looking at how many candies of each color we actually have (observed).
2. Calculating how many candies of each color we expect if they were mixed evenly (expected).
3. Using a special math trick (chi-square test) to compare what we see with what we expect.
4. Giving us a number (p-value) that tells us how likely it is that the candies are mixed randomly.

Thought Process for Writing the Code:

1. First, we need to import the necessary tools:
   - We use the main Go package and fmt for basic operations and printing.
   - We import special math tools from "gonum" to help with our calculations.

2. We set up our data:
   - We create a list of numbers (observed) representing what we actually counted.
   - We calculate another list (expected) based on what we think should happen if everything was evenly distributed.

3. We perform the chi-square test:
   - We use the stat.ChiSquare function to compare our observed and expected data.
   - This gives us a number (chiSquare) that represents how different our observed data is from what we expected.

4. We calculate the p-value:
   - We set up a special probability calculator (chiDist) for our chi-square distribution.
   - We use this to find out how likely our chi-square result is to happen by chance (pValue).

5. Finally, we print out our results:
   - We show the chi-square value and the p-value, which help us understand if our data shows a real pattern or if it's likely just random chance.

This code is a simplified way to perform a statistical test called the chi-square test of independence. It's used in many fields to analyze categorical data and determine if there's a significant relationship between different categories or if the observed differences are likely due to chance.
