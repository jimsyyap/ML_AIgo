This program is like creating a special toy box where you can put your toys and find them later. You create a box, put a toy in it with a special name tag, and then you can look inside the box to see all the toys you've put there.

Now, let's go through the thought process of writing this code:

1. We want to store information in a way that it doesn't disappear when we turn off the computer.

2. We decide to use a database called BoltDB, which is like a big, organized storage box for our computer.

3. We need to open (or create) our storage box.

4. Inside this big box, we want to create a smaller box (called a "bucket") to keep our things organized.

5. We'll put something in our small box.

6. Then we'll look inside the box to see what's there.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. We import the packages we need, including the BoltDB package.

2. We open our database file. If there's a problem, we tell the user and stop the program.

3. We make sure to close the database when we're done (using `defer`).

4. We create a new bucket (small box) in our database:
   - We use a special function that allows us to make changes (Update).
   - We name our bucket "MyBucket".
   - If there's a problem, we tell the user and stop.

5. We put something in our bucket:
   - We use another Update function.
   - We find our "MyBucket".
   - We put in a key "mykey" with a value "myvalue".

6. We look at what's in our bucket:
   - We use a View function (for looking, not changing).
   - We find our "MyBucket".
   - We use a special tool called a Cursor to look at everything in the bucket.
   - We print out each key and value we find.

This code demonstrates how to use BoltDB, an embedded key/value database for Go. It shows how to create a database, add data to it, and retrieve data from it. The thought process involves deciding on a storage method, figuring out how to organize the data (using buckets), and then performing basic operations like putting data in and getting it back out. This is useful for applications that need to store data persistently and efficiently access it later.
