This program is like a magic box that can remember things for a little while. You can put something in the box, and for a short time, you can ask the box if it still has that thing. If it does, it will show you what you put in. After a while, though, the box might forget what you put in it.

Now, let's go through the thought process of writing this code:

1. We want to create a program that can temporarily store and retrieve information quickly.

2. We decide to use a cache, which is like a short-term memory for our program.

3. We need to set up how long we want the cache to remember things.

4. We'll put something in the cache to test it.

5. Then we'll try to get that thing back out of the cache to make sure it worked.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. We import the packages we need:
   - "fmt" for printing
   - "time" for working with time durations
   - A cache package from GitHub

2. We create a new cache:
   - It will keep items for 5 minutes by default
   - It will clean up expired items every 10 minutes

3. We put something in the cache:
   - The key is "mykey"
   - The value is "myvalue"
   - We use the default expiration time

4. We try to get the item back from the cache:
   - We use the same key, "mykey"
   - The `Get` function returns two things: the value and a boolean telling us if it found anything

5. If the item was found in the cache, we print its value

This code demonstrates how to use a cache in Go. Caches are useful for storing temporary data that you want to access quickly without having to recalculate or fetch from a slow source each time. The thought process involves deciding on the cache duration, how to store items, and how to retrieve them. It's a simple example, but it shows the basic operations of setting and getting values from a cache.
