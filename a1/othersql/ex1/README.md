This program is like a friendly robot that tries to talk to a big box of information called a database. The robot needs a special code (like a secret password) to talk to the database. If it doesn't have the code, or if it can't talk to the database, it tells us there's a problem.

Now, let's go through the thought process of writing this code:

1. We want to connect to a PostgreSQL database.
2. We need the database's address, which we'll get from something called an environment variable.
3. We'll try to open a connection to the database.
4. We want to make sure the connection works by saying "hello" to the database (pinging it).
5. If anything goes wrong, we want to know about it.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. We import the packages we need:
   - "database/sql" for working with databases
   - "log" for reporting errors
   - "os" for getting environment variables
   - The PostgreSQL driver (we don't use it directly, that's why there's an underscore)

2. In our main program:
   - We try to get the database address (PGURL) from the environment variables.
   - If we can't find it, we stop the program and say the PGURL is empty.

3. We try to open a connection to the database:
   - We use `sql.Open` with "postgres" as the driver and our PGURL.
   - If there's a problem, we stop the program and report the error.

4. We tell the program to close the database connection when we're done, using `defer`.

5. We try to ping the database to make sure the connection works:
   - If there's a problem, we stop the program and report the error.

This code demonstrates how to set up a basic connection to a PostgreSQL database in Go. The thought process involves deciding how to get the database connection information (using an environment variable for security), opening the connection, and verifying that the connection works. This is a common pattern in programs that need to work with databases, as it ensures that the database is accessible before the program tries to use it for more complex operations.
