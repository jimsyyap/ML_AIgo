This code is like a set of instructions for a robot to talk to a big box that stores lots of information (we call this a database). The robot's job is to change some of the information in the box. Let's go through it step by step:

1. First, we tell the robot what tools it needs to do its job. It needs tools to talk to the big box and to write down what it does.

2. The robot looks for a special code (we call it PGURL) that tells it where to find the big box. If it can't find this code, it stops and tells us there's a problem.

3. If it finds the code, the robot tries to open the big box. If it can't open it, it stops and tells us there's a problem.

4. If it opens the box successfully, the robot has a special job to do. It needs to find all the flowers in the box that are called "Iris-setosa" and change their name to just "setosa".

5. After it does this job, the robot counts how many flowers it changed and writes down this number.

6. Finally, the robot tells us how many flowers it changed.

Now, let's think about how we would write these instructions:

1. We start by telling the robot what tools it needs. This is like packing a backpack for a trip.

2. Then we think about what could go wrong. What if we can't find the box? What if we can't open it? We write instructions for these problems.

3. We write the main job very carefully. We need to tell the robot exactly what to change and how to change it.

4. Finally, we make sure the robot tells us what it did, so we know if the job was done right.

This way of thinking helps us write clear instructions that handle problems and tell us what happened. It's like giving very detailed directions to someone who's never been to your house before.
