This program is like a helper that looks at a list of numbers in a special file (called a CSV file). It reads all the numbers and then tells you which one is the biggest. It's like if you had a bunch of toy cars and you wanted to find the longest one!

Now, let's go through the thought process of writing this code:

1. We want to read numbers from a CSV file.
2. We need to open the file and make sure we can read it.
3. We'll use a special tool to read CSV files.
4. We'll look at each number in the file.
5. We'll keep track of the biggest number we've seen.
6. At the end, we'll tell the user what the biggest number was.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. We import the packages we need:
   - "encoding/csv" to read CSV files
   - "fmt" to print things
   - "log" to report errors
   - "os" to open files
   - "strconv" to convert strings to numbers

2. We try to open the file "myfile.csv":
   - If there's a problem, we tell the user and stop the program.

3. We create a new CSV reader to read our file.

4. We read all the records from the CSV file:
   - If there's a problem, we tell the user and stop.

5. We create a variable to keep track of the biggest number (intMax).

6. We look at each record in the file:
   - We try to turn the first item in each record into a number.
   - If there's a problem doing this, we tell the user and stop.
   - If this number is bigger than the biggest we've seen so far, we remember it as the new biggest.

7. After looking at all the numbers, we print the biggest one.

This code demonstrates how to read data from a CSV file, convert strings to integers, and find the maximum value. The thought process involves deciding how to read the file (using the csv package), how to process each record (converting to integers), and how to keep track of the maximum value (using a variable and comparison). This kind of program is useful for analyzing data stored in CSV format, which is common for spreadsheets and simple databases.
